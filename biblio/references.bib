abstract = {Digital image processing technology has been widely applied in various fields, and it is also increasingly used in pavement distress detection in recent years. The objective of this review article is to help researchers to select the most appropriate digital image processing technology (image acquisition equipment, processing, recognition technology and etc.) to study the pavement distress detection. Firstly, a proper application of the current image acquisition equipment is presented, and the advantages and disadvantages are compared. Secondly, the problems encountered in the practical application of image processing technology in pavement detection are presented. Further, the problems need to be solved in the future research are suggested, including cracks detection, pavement texture detection, temperature segregation detection, rutting detection, pothole detection, and joint faulting detection. In conclusion, the state of the art in pavement detection by digital image processing technology is summarized and proves that the digital image processing technology has become a promising method for pavement detection and materials analysis.}

@article{crackseverity2023dl,
	abstract = {For the successful operation of pavement management system, it is necessary to automate the detection, classification, and severity assessment of road cracks, which are bottlenecks in the entire process. Although good results for the detection and classification of road cracks have been published in many related studies, the number of crack types detected is still insufficient for actual field use, and studies on crack severity assessment are difficult to find. In this study, the number of crack types are expanded to five types (alligator crack, longitudinal crack, transverse crack, pothole, and patching) to meet the needs of fieldwork, and the assessment of crack severity is also included in the proposed model. In this system constructed using SqueezeNet, U-Net, and Mobilenet-SSD models together, an accuracy of 91.2{\%} has been achieved for both crack type and severity assessment. The authors have performed segmentation of the input images using separately trained U-Nets for linear cracking and area cracking to improve object detection performance and automate crack severity assessment. With reference to the system presented in this study, it is expected that an automated pavement management system that better reflects each country's requirements for various crack types and severity standards is possible.},

@article{ren2024annotated,
	abstract = {Road damage is a great threat to the service life and safety of roads, and the early detection of pavement damage can facilitate maintenance and repair. Street view images serve as a new solution for the monitoring of pavement damage due to their wide coverage and regular updates. In this study, a road pavement damage dataset, the Street View Image Dataset for Automated Road Damage Detection (SVRDD), was developed using 8000 street view images acquired from Baidu Maps. Based on these images, over 20,000 damage instances were visually recognized and annotated. These instances were distributed in five administrative districts of Beijing City. Ten well-established object detection algorithms were trained and assessed using the SVRDD dataset. The results have demonstrated the performances of these algorithms in the detection of pavement damages. To the best of our knowledge, SVRDD is the first public dataset based on street view images for pavement damages detection. It can provide reliable data support for future development of deep learning algorithms based on street view images.},
